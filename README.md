# BIOMETRICS-FINGERPRINT-AUTHETICATION-AND-USER-RECOGNITION
Biometrics are physical or behavioral human characteristics to that can be used to digitally identify a person to grant access to systems, devices or data. Examples of these biometric identifiers are fingerprints, 

In this project we are going to authenticate users and make rasberrypi say their names with gtts library.


just make sure u install all the dependencies that u see in the project python file

SECURITY:
Here i have integrated raspberrypi camera and telegram bot for sending the froud detection..
telegram bot is to send the image of the person whose fingerprint mismatch.
I have also made python database connectivity to store user hash values in encrypted form.

REQUIREMENTS:
1). r307 fingerprint sensor 
2). A door lock 
3). raspberrypi 3B+
4). Raspberrypi cam.

RUN:
register user run        - python user_reg_voice.py
test the registered user - python test_speech_voice.py
delete the user          -  python delete_user.py
